# Duplicate Tab
Duplicate Tab is a Safari extension app for iOS and padOS that makes duplicating tabs much easier.

## Privacy PolicyÂ Â ðŸ”’
\* Duplicate Tab locally saves (on your device) whether or not you've made a tip in [User Defaults](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults). That is the only information saved. Duplicate Tab does not collect and/or transmit any data period. See so for yourself. â†‘

## QuestionsÂ Â ðŸ’­
### Why open source?
Following in the footsteps of [Amplosion](https://github.com/christianselig/Amplosion), I decided to show the source of this app so that people could see for themselves that nothing suspicious was going on. Not all parts of the app are included to prevent against people reuploading this app to the App Store with their name on it and the same icon.

### Is Duplicate Tab built from this source?
It isn't. This is an older version of the source. The source uploaded to the App Store includes StoreKit details, app icons, and other information I didn't want public.

## LicenseÂ Â ðŸš«
This software uses the [No License](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/) license. TLDR: You're not allowed to reupload this software, distribute, or sell it in anyway.

This code is shown for users of the app to have confidence that their data is not being collected and distributed. It is not here to be copied and reuploaded.
